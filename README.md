# Simple Discord Bot
Simple Discord bot, with discord.io library

Bot implementation steps:

1. Create a folder called **MyBot**
2. Install *Node.js library* via **CMD**: `pip install nodejs`
3. Type in CMD: `npm install`
4. To get started, you need token, which you need to put in the **auth.json** file ([Early Access](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/))
5. When you have completed the steps, write to CMD: `node bot.js`

**Protip**: You can find an option called *Open command window here* using `Shift + Right click Mouse`, That will get you to CMD faster!
